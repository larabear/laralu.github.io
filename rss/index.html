If you&#x2019;re more interested in learning the logistics side of things, please find relevant resources elsewhere. I want to make it clear that my case might be a bit different from many others: I have chronic back pain, which I think has a large negative impact on my mental health. I started writing this in my journal. The only reason I decided to polish it and share it is in case others find it relatable and helpful, because I want to help those like me. If not, that&#x2019;s totally fine too.</p><p>I started taking mental health leave late Feb. It&apos;s mid June now -- almost 4 months without working. I haven&apos;t felt as good as I do now probably since college, maybe high school. So 10 years at least - a very long time.</p><p>Like many other &#x201D;high-achievers (according to arbitrary definition)&#x201D;, I&apos;ve always been grinding for something: good schools, good jobs, deadlines, promotions&#x2026; One can say that I chose the grind. I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s entirely true, because I think valuing a comfortable life and financial stability couldn&#x2019;t be more reasonable, and it requires a lot of money. With the exception of the very occasional fine dining visits, I hardly buy anything luxurious. I just want to live in a sufficiently spacious home, in a safe neighborhood, be able to enjoy good weather and good food, travel and experience nature. I happen to have the privilege of being able to choose it by trading my time for work. Why wouldn&apos;t I? I want to support myself in the future. I don&apos;t know what the future holds, but I know that all good times eventually come to an end. I want to be prepared for the seasons of ups and downs, the patterns of news waves surpassing old waves. I want to save for the future.</p><p>The need for comfort and stability only contributes to part of my motivation for the grind. The rest is driven by my ego. In an increasingly more connected and competitive world, I become more aware of how I present myself in the context of others. What do others think of me? How do I want to be perceived? I crave for approvals and respect, so I grind in order to become my dream image - the 10x coder, the leader, the LevelX, the cool person. As I&apos;m writing this, there&apos;s an egotistical part of me that desperately hopes that it lands well and people won&apos;t think it&apos;s stupid and hopefully they will think I&apos;m smart.</p><p>Once the grind starts, it&#x2019;s hard to stop. There is always the next thing to go after, or as I call it, &#x201C;it&#x201D;. My waking hours revolve around &#x201C;it&#x201D;: when to get up, when to start the grind, when to rest so hopefully I can recover and do it all over again the next day. I end up grinding harder and harder, as &quot;it&quot; becomes increasingly harder to achieve. Staying put doesn&apos;t seem like an option. As the Chinese idiom goes, when you raft against the currents, if you don&apos;t move forward, you&apos;re moving backwards. &quot;It&quot; makes me short-sighted. I make choices for short-term gains at the expense of long-term loss. My emotions and behaviors become driven by &quot;it&quot;, which I have given up the driver seat to, barely noticing.</p><p>Before I know it, I don&#x2019;t know myself anymore, because I - my will - is no longer in control. My life is on autopilot. I do whatever &quot;it&quot; wants me to do: spending a ridiculous amount of time on work, fiercely trying to compete with others for the limited opportunities, turning a blind eye on the inauthentic things that stand in &#x201C;its&#x201D; way, doing what everyone else does, doing whatever the metrics tell me to do.</p><p>What do I want? I don&apos;t know anymore. But I didn&apos;t take the leave to figure out what I wanted. I did because I physically couldn&apos;t keep it up anymore. My body was filled with constant tension and stress. My heart was racing when I had to join meetings. My mind jumped between different problems. My breaths were shallow and short. I didn&apos;t have any excitement when I woke up. I couldn&apos;t wait for the day to be over and the night to start so I could have some temporary relief, but then I couldn&apos;t fall asleep at night as all the worries occupy my mind. I seemed to need endless sleep on the weekends to recover. One time I went to the ER convinced that I had a heart issue because I felt like I couldn&apos;t breathe, only to be told that my vitals were normal and it was probably stress. I developed Shingles Rash which my doctor suspected was due to stress. Thanks to therapy, I realized that this wasn&apos;t normal. But it&apos;s a different beast to try to come down to what&apos;s normal for me. Meditation didn&apos;t seem to be effective. After taking over a week of PTO and still unable to relax, I decided to take mental health leave.</p><p>I couldn&apos;t be more thankful for it - really. As I mentioned, I feel better now than most of the past 10 years. I feel like myself again. I feel so connected to the people and things and little moments in my daily life - the last time I felt this was when I was a child. I couldn&apos;t believe that I have been so numb for so long.</p><p>And I wouldn&apos;t be able to do it without the long break. It took a couple of weeks for my work stress to soften and dissipate, and many more for me to settle back to a calm state, where I re-discover what I enjoy and what I don&apos;t enjoy and regain control over my life. To go from a high vibration high tension state to a calm and joyful state is a journey that could take a long time, but there&apos;s virtually zero option within the normal work framework to allow for such a long time. A typical PTO isn&apos;t enough. A gap in-between jobs is possible, but with all the uncertainty on the horizon, there&apos;s immense value associated with the safety net of a job, and the stress about employment risks is likely not going to help with healing. That&#x2019;s why I think the option of medical leave is an amazing benefit. Not everyone is privileged to have access to it, but for those who are, I think it&apos;s a wonderful thing to take advantage of for our well being.</p><p>Now it&apos;s almost time for me to go back to work again in a different environment. I feel scared, to be honest. Regardless of where I work, in tech, the currents of the water are strong and stealth. It&apos;s so easy to be carried away and so hard to stay clear-headed. I pray that I won&apos;t get numb in the currents again, because when I&#x2019;m numb, I am usually not aware, not to mention un-numbing myself. Even if I am aware, it&apos;s very hard to actually go back to calm in these currents. The thought of feeling numb for another 10 years makes me feel very, very sad. In all sincerity and with no intention of hyperbole, I think it&apos;s cruel to subject a human to this numbness, and yet so many of us live our lives numb. I hope that if when I get numb, I will have the time, the space and the wisdom to find calm again. I hope that the currents will be kind too.<br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>After publishing a note around mental health leave internally at Meta and finding that some people resonated, I decided to set up a blog as a channel to potentially share more thoughts in the future.
